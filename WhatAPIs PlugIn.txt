
IDA WhatAPIs
=========================================================
IDA Pro plug-in to display contextual function API usage.
By Sirmabus


----- [Description] -----------------------------------------------------------
This plug-in will walk all of the functions in the loaded IDB and show you
what APIs are used inside each of these functions shown as a function comment.
The idea being to give you some helpful contextual information at a glance in
aid to reverse engineering.

----- [Install] ---------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the plug-in to your IDA Pro "plugins" directory.
Then edit your "..\plugins\plugins.cfg" to setup with a hotkey.

For example add these two lines:
; Sirmabus WhatAPIs plug-in
IDA_WhatAPIs_PlugIn.plw IDA_WhatAPIs_PlugIn.plw Ctrl-8 0

See IDA documentation for more on installing and using plug-ins.

----- [How to run it] ---------------------------------------------------------
Invoke like any other plug-in in IDA through the hot key, or via IDA's
Edit->Plugins menu.

Note: If you use my other contextual text comment plug-ins you should run them
in this exact order since some prepend, while others append their comments:
1) Function String Associate
2) Mark reference counts
3) WhatAPIs

Click "Continue" and let it run.

After it's done, browse around and you should now see appended function
API comments!

----- [Design] ----------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing too fancy, pretty simple, but maybe useful for others.
This is something that just came to me one day while spending many countless
hours reversing.

The APIs that a function might contain can be considered pretty significant.
The ability to see this infomation easier/quicker could be helpful.
